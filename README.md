# Welcome!

[NRE Labs](https://labs.networkreliability.engineering) is an open-source project and website for teaching network automation using real virtual environments that are provisioned on-demand and presented interactively in your web browser.

It's powered by the [Antidote](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote) platform, which provides an abstraction to enable curriculum-as-code, meaning all learning materials can be represented as simple text files, stored in a Git repository.

Documentation for both can be found in the navigation menus to the left.
