# Object Reference

In Antidote, all curriculum content is defined through a set of types, usually represented either as YAML files, or as properties of a type that is represented in a YAML file.

These types are known as "Objects", and are stored as files within a Git repository that forms a curriculum. This section of the documentation is meant to be used as a reference - all supported Antidote objects are defined and explained in these sections.

Antidote is a platform for bringing otherwise complicated technical learning material to the masses, by taking care of the complexity behind the scenes, out of sight of the learner. To that end, there are a variety of tools we make available to you, the lesson author / teacher to make this possible.

Some tools are designed to make things easier to teach, others makes things easier to learn, other things do both. Please read through this portion of the documentation so you don't miss out on any useful tools you can leverage to really make your content stand out.
