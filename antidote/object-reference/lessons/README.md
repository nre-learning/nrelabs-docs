## Lessons

Antidote is a platform for bringing otherwise complicated technical learning material to the masses, by taking care of the complexity behind the scenes, out of sight of the learner. To that end, there are a variety of tools we make available to you, the lesson author / teacher to make this possible.

Some tools are designed to make things easier to teach, others makes things easier to learn, other things do both. Please read through this portion of the documentation so you don't miss out on any useful tools you can leverage to really make your content stand out.

Lessons are the quintessential curriculum resource. When Syringe starts, it looks for lesson definitions within the configured curriculum directory, loads them into memory, and serves them directly via its API. These lesson definitions are written in YAML. A reasonably complete example is shown below. Don't worry about understanding it for now - below the example, we'll explain the beginning of the file, which describes some metadata about the Lesson. We'll also link to other documents which go into detail on Endpoints, Connections, and Stages.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't worry. This file can be broken up into sections, and we'll do this to explain it, piece by piece. For now, let's just focus on the top portion:

This section contains metadata about this lesson. This isn't directly concerned with the actual content you're trying to convey through a lesson, but it's very valuable for helping users find the content, and use it within their learning journey. Below is a table which describes each field:

.. NOTE::

Some of these fields are required, some aren't. Some have a length requirement, and others don't. For guidance here, you should definitely get up to speed with the `syrctl` tool. That tool has a :ref:`validation function <syrctl-validate>` you can run on a curriculum, and it will let you know if anything needs fixed.

===================== ============================================================ lessonName The human-readable name for a lesson. Kind of like a blog post title. lessonId A unique ID for this lesson. You can assign this yourself, as long as it's unique in this curriculum. category The category for this lesson - supported options are "fundamentals", "tools", and "workflows" lessonDiagram An internet-accessible URL to an image to use as a diagram for this lesson tier The environment this lesson is meant to run in. Options are "local", "ptr", and "prod" prereqs A list of lesson IDs that a learner should go to first, to prepare for this lesson properly. description A slightly more long-form explanation of what's included in this lesson slug Ideally, a very short \(1-3 words\) summary of this lesson. Used for searching. tags A list of keywords that are included in this lesson. Used for searching. ===================== ============================================================

The remaining sections are explained in separate documents:

* The `endpoints` section is explained in :ref:`endpoints <endpoints>`.
* The `connections` section is explained in :ref:`connections <connections>`.
* The `stages` section is explained in :ref:`stages <stages>`.
