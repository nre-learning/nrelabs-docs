# Connections

Another cool thing about Antidote is that it allows lesson creators to build complex topologies of Endpoints through some simple back-end networking orchestrated by [Syringe]() and made possible by Kubernetes and a special networking plugin.

We explain **how** this all works over in the [Architecture docs](../../antidote-architecture/). The way you use this functionality in a lesson is fairly simple. The first thing you should know is that all Endpoints are connected to the same "management" network. The `eth0` interface of every container is connected here, and each can communicate with each other by default.

The example below shows three Endpoints in a lesson definition:

```text
- name: vqfx1
  image: antidotelabs/vqfx-snap1
  configurationType: napalm-junos
  presentations:
  - name: cli
    port: 22
    type: ssh

- name: vqfx2
  image: antidotelabs/vqfx-snap2
  configurationType: napalm-junos
  presentations:
  - name: cli
    port: 22
    type: ssh

- name: vqfx3
  image: antidotelabs/vqfx-snap3
  configurationType: napalm-junos
  presentations:
  - name: cli
    port: 22
    type: ssh
```

You can think of these like nodes in a graph topology, as all networks are. So, if Endpoints are nodes, then the edges, or the connections between these nodes, are `connections`:

```text
connections:
- a: vqfx1
  b: vqfx2
- a: vqfx2
  b: vqfx3
- a: vqfx3
  b: vqfx1
```

This is a simple list of connections from `a` to `b`. The first connection is from `vqfx1` to `vqfx2` and so on. Syringe will create virtual networks for each Connection, and then attach Endpoints to them.

You can see the attachment to these networks by describing any Kubernetes pod using the `kubectl` CLI that represents an Endpoint:

```text
kubectl -n=12-abcdefghijkl-ns describe pod vqfx1
Name:               vqfx1
Namespace:          12-abcdefghijkl-ns
Priority:           0
PriorityClassName:  <none>

                    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status:
                    [{
                        "name": "",
                        "ips": [
                            "10.32.29.138"
                        ],
                        "default": true,
                        "dns": {}
                    },{
                        "name": "12-abcdefghijkl-ns-vqfx1-vqfx2-net",
                        "ips": [
                            "10.10.0.2"
                        ],
                        "dns": {}
                    },{
                        "name": "12-abcdefghijkl-ns-vqfx3-vqfx1-net",
                        "ips": [
                            "10.10.0.2"
                        ],
                        "dns": {}
```

As mentioned previously, the first interface/network is always the "management" network, and since `vqfx1` was a member of two defined Connections, it has two additional networks.
