# The Antidote CLI

The Antidote platform also comes with a CLI tool called `antidote`, which is meant to be used primarily by curriculum authors to validate or create new curriculum content like lessons.

You can [always find the latest release here](https://github.com/nre-learning/syringe/releases/latest), where pre-compiled binaries for Antidote have been posted. Download the file appropriate for your system, and extract the binaries into a directory on your `$PATH` \(or extract them anywhere and run via relative path\). Either is fine.
