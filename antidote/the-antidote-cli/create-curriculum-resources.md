# Create Curriculum Resources

Next thing you'll want to do is bookmark the [Antidote Object Reference](../object-reference/). All curriculum resources, such as lessons, are defined "as-code", meaning they are all defined using simple text files stored in Git. This documentation is vital for knowing what kind of things you can use to create an awesome lesson, so read that carefully, and follow the instructions there, whether you're creating a new lesson, or modifying an existing one.
