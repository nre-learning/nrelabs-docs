# Validating an Existing Curriculum

One of the things `syrctl` can do for us is validate lesson content to make sure it has all of the basics to work properly. This is done via the sub-command `syrctl validate`. This command is directed at a curriculum directory in order to work: for instance, we have the NRE Labs curriculum installed locally:

```text
~$ ls -lha
total 68K
drwxr-xr-x  6 mierdin mierdin 4.0K Apr 21 22:52 .
drwxr-xr-x 10 mierdin mierdin 4.0K Apr 15 23:19 ..

-rwxr-xr-x  1 mierdin mierdin  288 Apr 15 15:19 validate-lessons.share
```

We're already `cd`'d into this directory, so we just need to run `syrctl validate .` to instruct syrctl to validate the local directory:

```text
~$ syrctl validate .

```

This runs the exact same logic that `syringed` would use to load lessons on the server-side, so this is a really handy way to make sure the basics of curriculum definitions are done correctly.

On the [NRE Labs Curriculum repository](https://github.com/nre-learning/nrelabs-curriculum), we're actually running `syrctl validate` on every new Pull Request to ensure things are set up properly, as much as possible.

There are things it won't check - like the validity of a network configuration, or that your Docker image is built properly, but in terms of the things that Syringe requires, it will give you confidence in a stable starting point, rather than reading through a list of points in this doc.
