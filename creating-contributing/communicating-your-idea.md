# Communicating Your Idea

So, you want to contribute to the NRE Labs curriculum! Great, and thank you! Please read on for some helpful hints that will guide you along the process and ensure your time is spent wisely.

The NRE Labs curriculum should be treated like any other open source project. It's built via contributions from all over the world, all the time. So before getting started, you should first spend time communicating your plans with the rest of the community.

First, peruse the [existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/nre-learning/nrelabs-curriculum/issues) to see if anyone is already working on something similar to what you have in mind. Maybe someone else is looking to build a similar lesson, and this gives you the opportunity to combine forces with these existing efforts if they exist. A single lesson that covers all the bases is way better than two similar lessons that have overlap and confuse the learner. If this exists, post to that issue and indicate you'd like to contribute.

If no existing issue exists, you should [open an issue](https://github.com/nre-learning/nrelabs-curriculum/issues/new) for yourself so the community can have a chance to provide feedback on your idea before you spend time building it. This will save you a lot of headache in the future.

In this issue, provide as much detail as you can, such as your target audience, and what learners should be expected to get out of this lesson. Remember that this is learning content, so it's not enough to just have a bunch of commands for the learner to run - they should be able to get something tangible from your lesson that they can immediately apply in their day-to-day work.

If you're building a lesson, it's important that you include an outline of what will be contained within the lesson. Each lesson is built of multiple stages, so you should be able to summarize each in a bullet. Note that each stage should follow some kind of natural progression, and should take no more than 10 minutes for the learner to finish.
