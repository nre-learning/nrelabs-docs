# Preview Your Changes

> This portion of the contribution pipeline is new, and still under active development. If you encounter issues here, you may consider following the instructions for [getting a copy of the NRE Labs software running on your laptop](../other-resources/previewing-locally.md). This is the legacy way of previewing content, and does involve a lot more technical know-how, but is an option for you.
>
> Please [post to the forums](https://discuss.nrelabs.io/c/antidote-support/5) if you have issues with this documentation or the preview service.

Once all status checks for a given Pull Request pass, the NRE Labs Preview Service will automatically generate a live preview of your changes, and post these details via a comment in your Pull Request.

Note that previews are not generated if the branch doesn't pass the other CI checks, so if you're not seeing this, ensure that you aren't seeing any errors from Travis CI.
