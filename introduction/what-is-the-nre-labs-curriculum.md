# What is NRE Labs?

NRE Labs is both the name of a website, as well as the name of the open source project behind that website and all of the subprojects that make it possible.

This experience is made possible by the Antidote platform, which was originally created to be used in the NRE Labs project but can be used in a variety of other ways. The documentation for Antidote can be found &lt;here&gt;.
