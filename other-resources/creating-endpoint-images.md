# Creating Endpoint Images

In general, new curriculum content like lessons should take advantage of the Endpoint images that already exist. Images are not meant to be used once, for one lesson - they are meant to be standalone resources that could be used in multiple lessons as the need arises.

However sometimes the creation of new images is warranted, and this doc describes the process for doing this.



1\) it should be handled separate from and in advance of any lessons that may wish to use it \(i.e. open a PR to contribute the image first\)

2\) This doc will also describe the process for creating images with commercial software content that you don't wish to be publicly available outside of NRE Labs
